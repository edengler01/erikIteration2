# Racoon Bazaar

## System Overview
The purpose for Racoon Bazaar is to have a platform for students to buy and sell their textbooks they no longer need

## Design Considerations
The system is designed to be used by university students, who we can assume are more well-versed with dealing with online platforms such as this when compared the greater population.


## Archectural Strategies
The system will be build using Node.js with various modules such as:

- [Body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser): for processing HTTP request data
- [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): for creation and use of environment variables for things such as database info, api keys, etc
- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): for server handling
- [Express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session): for creating a session storing account information    
- [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2): for database handling
- [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt): for hashing passwords and all that jazz

## Use Cases 
##### Student selling a book
A student can put their books for sale on the app. They navigate to the Sell Your Books tab. They are prompted to enter 
the name of the book, the author of the book, the course code that the book is assigned to, the current condition of the book and the price that the person wants to sell it for. Once the input fields have been verified to be filled, the database will hold that users book and then send it to the server so it can be shown to anyone who is browsing for books.
